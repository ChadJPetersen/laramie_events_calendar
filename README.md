# laramie_events_calendar
https://www.visitlaramie.org/events/ is a great resource for finding things to do in laramie. But I always forget to look at what's going on. I live by my calendar. So thought it would be interesting to try and get laramie events to show up as an ICS feed.

in short. Exposes visit laramie events as an ICS at:
https://chadjpetersen.github.io/laramie_events_calendar/events.ics

you can then add that feed to the calendar of your choice (e.g. apple, google, microsoft, etc.)
